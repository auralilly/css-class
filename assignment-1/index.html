        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <blockquote>
          You see that glass half empty<br>
          Each time you look in the mirror<br>
          It's like the more you're trying<br>
          Your flaws start showing up clearer<br>
          You bleed emotion, so devoted to what people say<br>
          So sick of hoping, so you focus on all your mistakes<br>
          Stop changing, there's nothing to fix when life's a war for you<br>
          That's when your pulse becomes the proof<br>
          <br>
          When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell<br>
          And nobody understands that you are going through hell<br>
          Right here, like this, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough<br>
          Being human is what makes you something worthy of love<br>
          Right here, this sick, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          So don't give up<br>
          <br>
          With every passing stranger<br>
          You find something that you're missing<br>
          So kind, except to yourself<br>
          You're anything but forgiving<br>
          You bleed emotion, so devoted to what people say<br>
          Give second chances left and right, and only take the blame<br>
          Don't change a single thing 'cause there is nothing wrong with you<br>
          What you feel now, don't make it truth<br>
          <br>
          When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell<br>
          And nobody understands that you are going through hell<br>
          Right here, like this, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough<br>
          Being human is what makes you something worthy of love<br>
          Right here, this sick, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          <br>
          Stop chasing something that you're never gonna find<br>
          Already perfect, but your past has left you blind<br>
          So when the voices in your head ain't being kind<br>
          Here is something to remind you<br>
          <br>
          When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell<br>
          And nobody understands that you are going through hell<br>
          Right here, like this, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough<br>
          Being human is what makes you something worthy of love<br>
          Right here, this sick, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          So don't give up
