        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <blockquote>
          You see that glass half empty<br>
          Each time you look in the mirror<br>
          It's like the more you're trying<br>
          Your flaws start showing up clearer<br>
          You bleed emotion, so devoted to what people say<br>
          So sick of hoping, so you focus on all your mistakes<br>
          Stop changing, there's nothing to fix when life's a war for you<br>
          That's when your pulse becomes the proof<br>
          <br>
          When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell<br>
          And nobody understands that you are going through hell<br>
          Right here, like this, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough<br>
          Being human is what makes you something worthy of love<br>
          Right here, this sick, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          So don't give up<br>
          <br>
          With every passing stranger<br>
          You find something that you're missing<br>
          So kind, except to yourself<br>
          You're anything but forgiving<br>
          You bleed emotion, so devoted to what people say<br>
          Give second chances left and right, and only take the blame<br>
          Don't change a single thing 'cause there is nothing wrong with you<br>
          What you feel now, don't make it truth<br>
          <br>
          When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell<br>
          And nobody understands that you are going through hell<br>
          Right here, like this, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough<br>
          Being human is what makes you something worthy of love<br>
          Right here, this sick, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          <br>
          Stop chasing something that you're never gonna find<br>
          Already perfect, but your past has left you blind<br>
          So when the voices in your head ain't being kind<br>
          Here is something to remind you<br>
          <br>
          When you're a little messed up, when you're a little unwell<br>
          And nobody understands that you are going through hell<br>
          Right here, like this, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          When you've been broken and bruised because the past has been tough<br>
          Being human is what makes you something worthy of love<br>
          Right here, this sick, right now<br>
          You are enough<br>
          So don't give up

        <h2>About the Song</h2>
        <p>I cherish this song so much because it helpes with depression, or simply just being in a hard place. Its a song I listen to even now, because I just enjoy the lyrics, but it also helps me be a little bit happier.It is a song I lesten to when I'm stressed with college work, as it helps me just unwind. That is why I think it would be good for anyone in a bad spot, or just need a pick me up for sensative subjects</p>

        <h2>About Citizen Soldier</h2>
        <p>This is why i realy admire this band. Citizen Soldier is an American rock band founded in 2016, known for using music to raise awareness about mental health issues including depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction, and suicide prevention. Led by vocalist Jake Segura, the band blends post-hardcore, alternative rock, and cinematic sounds to create deeply personal and relatable songs. Their lyrics often speak directly to listeners who feel misunderstood or isolated. </p>
